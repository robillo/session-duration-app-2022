Do you like practising your English pronunciation? Have fun saying tongue twisters in English.
We introduce you to a specially sorted collection of tongue twisters into 10 levels on the basis of their difficulty.

We’re going to give you a way on how to improve English speaking with some tongue twisters. Improving your spoken English is always going to be a challenge, especially if you’re not in an English speaking environment or if you’re with a group of people who refuse to stop speaking your native language!
By their very nature, tongue twisters are challenging to say.
With their repetitive use of similar sounding sounds, words and syllables, they can trip up the tongues of even the most articulate individuals.
However, as fun as they are, tongue twisters have a very practical application.
As such, tongue twisters can be used to treat speech problems in speech therapy, and help reduce the prominence of a foreign accent.
This use of tongue twisters in speech therapy is universal for all ages and users!

Tongue twisters are a great way to practice and improve pronunciation and fluency. They can also help to improve accents by using alliteration, which is the repetition of one sound. They’re not just for kids, but are also used by actors, politicians, and public speakers who want to sound clear when speaking. The app features several hand-picked English Tongue Twisters to enhance the clarity of your speaking in English language.
